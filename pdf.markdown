CHAOS #1 to #501 is a collection of 501 unique digital sculptures, released as individual NFTs.

CHAOS #1–#500 consists of two converging objects in motion. Each pair is made of two distinct objects that stay in continuous connection. The two objects are relative in scale to one another. Each object is unique.

The individual objects selected for CHAOS are engineered, cultured or manufactured by humans and sourced from the physical world and transformed into a 3D digital model through 3D scanning.

CHAOS #501 is the cumulation of all of the individual objects from CHAOS #1–#500\. In #501 all 1,000 objects from #1–#500 come together decoupled from their original pair and move independently from each other.

Each sculpture is independent of the other #s in the collection.

A visualization can manifest in any format that is capable of displaying, playing or showing a digital sculpture in motion, in 2 or 3 dimensions, in any space, be it virtual, real, or a fusion of the two, through current and future technology.

The artwork is composed of a file representing the objects. The owner of a CHAOS NFT is entitled to:

1\. A reference rendering.

2\. Access to the raw data. This data facilitates the owner to construct interpretations of the sculpture.

3\. A set of instructions on how to render the artwork.

The reference rendering is one possible way to represent the sculpture.

To gain access, the owner will prove ownership over the NFT which allows them to download the digital files.

The sculptures will be revealed and released over several months, culminating with #501 as the capstone piece. Each of CHAOS #1–#500 will remain secret until released. A version of #501 in progress will be revealed incrementally, showing only those objects from sculptures that have been revealed.

All copyrights in the Work are and shall remain the exclusive property of the Artist.

Upon purchase, the buyer will be given the right to use, distribute and display the creation for non-commercial purposes only.
